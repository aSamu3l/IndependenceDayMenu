# IndependenceDayMenu

## Description
It is a simple project that uses PHP to generate an HTML site from a JSON file where all the courses of the Independence Day lunch/dinner are written so that guests can see the menu directly from their phone.

## How to use

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/aSamu3l/IndependenceDayMenu.git
   cd IndependenceDayMenu
   ```

2. **Modify the menu:**
   - Open the `menu.json` file in a text editor.
   - Update the menu items as needed. For example:
      ```json
      {
         "appetizer": [
            "Buffalo Wings",
            "Stuffed Jalape√±os"
         ],
         "first course": [
            "Clam Chowder",
            "Caesar Salad"
         ],
         "main course": [
            "BBQ Ribs",
            "Grilled Burgers",
            "Hot Dogs"
         ],
         "dessert": [
            "Apple Pie",
            "Cheesecake",
            "Brownies"
         ]
      }
      ```

3. **Set up a web server:**
   - **Apache:**
     1. Ensure Apache is installed and running.
     2. Place the project directory in the Apache `htdocs` directory (e.g., `/var/www/html/IndependenceDayMenu`).
     3. Access the project in your browser at `http://localhost/IndependenceDayMenu`.

   - **Nginx:**
     1. Ensure Nginx is installed and running.
     2. Configure Nginx to serve the project directory. Add a server block in your Nginx configuration:
        ```nginx
        server {
            listen 80;
            server_name localhost;

            root /path/to/IndependenceDayMenu;
            index index.php index.html;

            location / {
                try_files $uri $uri/ =404;
            }

            location ~ \.php$ {
                include snippets/fastcgi-php.conf;
                fastcgi_pass unix:/var/run/php/php7.4-fpm.sock;
            }
        }
        ```
     3. Reload Nginx configuration:
        ```sh
        sudo systemctl reload nginx
        ```
     4. Access the project in your browser at `http://<your-ip>`.

4. **View the IndependenceDay menu:**
   Open your web browser and navigate to the appropriate URL (e.g., `http://<your-ip>/IndependenceDayMenu` for Apache or `http://<your-ip>` for Nginx) to see the IndependenceDay menu.
